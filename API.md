### 🔓 `GET /api/events/{event_id}`

Get a single event with seat map / availability.

> **Cross-service assembly (choreography):** The `seats` array in the response is assembled by the **Event Service itself** — it calls the **Inventory Service's internal HTTP endpoint** to fetch seat statuses for the given `event_id`, then merges the result with its own event/venue data before returning the combined response. The Orchestrator is **not** involved in this call. This is an instance of direct service-to-service choreography.

**Path Parameters:**

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `event_id` | UUID | Event identifier |

**Success Response (200):**

```json

## 14. Swagger / Flasgger Integration Plan

### Library

[**Flasgger**](https://github.com/flasgger/flasgger) — a Flask extension that extracts OpenAPI/Swagger specs from Flask view docstrings and serves Swagger UI.

### Setup

```bash
pip install flasgger
```

Add to each Flask service's `requirements.txt`:

```text
flasgger==0.9.7.1
```

### Integration (per service)

```python
from flask import Flask
from flasgger import Swagger

app = Flask(__name__)

swagger_config = {
    "headers": [],
    "specs": [
        {
            "endpoint": "apispec",
            "route": "/apispec.json",
            "rule_filter": lambda rule: True,
            "model_filter": lambda tag: True,
        }
    ],
    "static_url_path": "/flasgger_static",
    "swagger_ui": True,
    "specs_route": "/apidocs/"
}

swagger_template = {
    "info": {
        "title": "TicketRemaster - Orchestrator Service",
        "description": "API documentation for the Orchestrator Service",
        "version": "1.0.0"
    },
    "securityDefinitions": {
        "Bearer": {
            "type": "apiKey",
            "name": "Authorization",
            "in": "header",
            "description": "JWT Authorization header. Example: 'Bearer {token}'"
        }
    }
}

swagger = Swagger(app, config=swagger_config, template=swagger_template)
```

### Swagger UI Access

| Service | Swagger UI URL |
| --- | --- |
| Orchestrator | `http://localhost:5003/apidocs/` |
| User Service | `http://localhost:5000/apidocs/` |
| Order Service | `http://localhost:5001/apidocs/` |
| Event Service | `http://localhost:5002/apidocs/` |

### Implementation Tasks

- [ ] Add `flasgger` to each service's `requirements.txt`
- [ ] Add Swagger init boilerplate to each `app.py`
- [ ] Write YAML docstrings for every endpoint (can be done incrementally as services are built)
- [ ] Test Swagger UI loads and all endpoints appear
- [ ] Add `securityDefinitions` for JWT Bearer token

```
